"""
Working with the UCSC Genome Browser binning scheme.

These are some utility functions for working with genomic regions and the
binning scheme as used in the UCSC Genome Browser [1].

Note that all genomic positions in this module are one-based and inclusive.

@todo: Implement the extended binning scheme (for positions > 2^29).
@todo: Be more flexible in the binning scheme to use.
@todo: Other useful functions?
